# TCG-Re
## This is the online repository of the ESEC/FSE2022 paper titled "Data Flow Reduction based Test Case Generation for Smart Contracts".

TCG-Re is an improved approach to generate test cases based on data flow reduction for smart contracts, which can generate test cases that can achieve complete coverage of most smart contracts and find some programming errors in the contracts.

## Dataset

This dataset, including 40 smart contracts of various scales, was collected from the open-source smart contract dataset on Github and on the Ethereum platform for experimental evaluation.
