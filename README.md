# TCG-Re


TCG-Re is an improved approach to generate test cases based on data flow reduction and improved genetic algorithm for smart contracts, which can generate test cases that can achieve complete coverage of most smart contracts and find some programming errors in the contracts.

## Dataset

This dataset, including 40 smart contracts of various scales, was collected from the open-source smart contract dataset on Github and on the Ethereum platform for experimental evaluation.
